        <h2>Collaboration Details</h2>
        <p>We are organizing a Steam cross-promotion event centered around the media efforts of Perfect Hand of Nostalpix and Card Nova Hyper. </p>
        <p>We will be paying for a media campaign in multiple press release platforms. A new content update is coming to the game and we are planning to use a Steam visibility round during that period. </p>
        <p>Games who want to participate are required to write two cross promotional Steam events to coincide with the media efforts in February and April.</p>
        <p>In return, we will also create two cross promotional Steam events in our end, liking to the Steam page of the partners.</p>

        <p>The goal is to boost wishlists and sales for the participating games.</p>
        <p>Additionally, optional promotions through social media, newsletters, and Discord are encouraged.</p>
